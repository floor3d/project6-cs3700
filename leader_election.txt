5. send out requestvoat message
6. other servers reset election timeouts & respond to candidate with a vote
7. if majority: leader; send appendentries to give logz
8. if nothin: try again after _election timeout_
9. if you are candidate and someone w/ higher term sends request voat, become follower and vote and update term
10.if a follower hasn't received any comms from leader / candidate after _leader timeout_ become candidate and start new election with new term



TIMEOUTS:
1. leader timeout: timeout while a follower. if no word from other slimes, begin new election
--> this should be initial state as well as repeated normally
2. election timeout: timeout when voting; after voting wait for a little and if no word then fuck it
